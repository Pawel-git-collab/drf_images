# Project Documentation

## Functional Specification

- available only for logged-in users
- users should be able to upload images via HTTP request
- users should be able to list their images
- there are three builtin account tiers: Basic, Premium and Enterprise:
    - users that have "Basic" plan after uploading an image get:
        - a link to a thumbnail that's 200px in height
    - users that have "Premium" plan get:
        - a link to a thumbnail that's 200px in height
        - a link to a thumbnail that's 300px in height
        - a link to the originally uploaded image
    - users that have "Enterprise" plan get
        - a link to a thumbnail that's 200px in height
        - a link to a thumbnail that's 300px in height
        - a link to the originally uploaded image
        - ability to fetch an expiring link to the image (the link expires after a given number of seconds (the user can
          specify any number between 300 and 30000))
- apart from the builtin tiers, admins should be able to create arbitrary tiers with the following things configurable:
  - arbitrary thumbnail sizes
  - presence of the link to the originally uploaded file
  - ability to generate expiring links
- admin UI should be done via django-admin
- there should be no custom user UI (just browsable API from Django Rest Framework)
